h1. Setup

h2. Goals

* To setup git so that it is ready for work.

h2. Steps

h3. Setup Name and Email

p. If you have never used git before, you need to do some setup first.
Run the following commands so that git knows your name and email.  If
you have git already setup, you can skip down to the line ending
section.

execute:
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config -- user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
 
h3. Setup Line Ending Preferences

Also, for Unix/Mac users:

execute:
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.safecrlf true

And for Windows users:

execute:
git config --global core.autocrlf true
git config --global core.safecrlf true

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. More Setup

h2. Goals

* Get the tutorial materials setup and ready to run.

h2. Steps

h3. Get the Tutorial package.

p. Git the tutorial package from either:

* The memory sticks provided in the tutorial
* The URL "http://onestepback.org/download/git_tutorial.zip":http://onestepback.org/download/git_tutorial.zip

h3. Unzip the tuturial

p. The tutorial package should have a main diretory "git_tutorial"
with three sub-directories:

* html -- These html files.  Point your browser to html/index.html
* repos -- Prepackages repos for later use
* work -- An empty working directory.  Create your repos in here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. Create a Project

h2. Goals

* Learn how to create a git repository from scratch.

h2. Steps

h3. Create a "Hello, World" program

p. Starting in the empty working directory, create an empty directory
named "hello", then create a file named @hello.rb@ with the contents
below.

Execute:
mkdir hello
cd hello

File: hello.rb
puts "Hello, World"
EOF

h3. Create the Repository

p. You now have a directory with a single file.  To create a git
repository from that directory, run the git init command.

Execute:
git init
=init

Output:
=init
EOF

h3. Add the program to the repository

Now let's add the "Hello, World" program to the repository.

Execute:
git add hello.rb
=add
git commit -m 'First Commit'
=commit

p. You should see ...

Output:
=add
=commit
EOF

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. Checking Status

h2. Goals

* Learn how to check the status of the repository

h2. Steps

h3. Check the status of the repository 

p. Use the @git status@ command to check the current status of the
repository.

Execute:
git status
=status

p. You should see

Output:
=status
EOF

p. The status command reports that there is nothing to commit.  This
means that the repository has all the current state of the working
directory.  There are no outstanding changes to record.

p. We will use the @git status@ command to continue to monitor the
state between the repository and the working directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. Making Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn how to monitor the state of the working directory

h2. Steps

h3. Change the "Hello, World" program.

p. It's time to change our hello program to take an argument from the
command line.  Change the file to be:

File: hello.rb
puts "Hello, #{ARGV.first}!"
EOF

h3. Check the status

p. Now check the status of the working directory.  

Execute:
!git status
=status

p. You should see ...

Output:
=status
EOF

p. The first thing to notice is that git knows that the @hello.rb@
file has been modified, but git has not yet been notified of these
changes.

p. Also notice that the status message gives you hints about what you
need to do next.  If you want to add these changes to the repository,
then use the @git add@ command.  Otherwise the @git checkout@ command
can be used to discard the changes.

h3. Up Next

p. Let's stage the change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Staging Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn how to stage changes for later commits

h2. Steps

h3. Add Changes

p. Now tell git to stage the changes.  Check the status

Execute:
git add hello.rb
=add
git status
=status

p. You should see ...

Output:
=add
=status
EOF

p. The change to the @hello.rb@ file has been staged.  This means that
git now knows about the change, but the changes hasn't been
_permanently recorded in the repository yet.  The next commit
operation will included the staged changes.

p. If you decide you _don't_ want to commit that change after all, the
status command reminds you that the @git reset@ command can be used to
unstage that change.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Staging and Committing

p. A separate staging step in git is in line with the philosophy of
getting out of the way until you need to deal with source control.
You can continue to make changes to your working directory, and then
at the point you want to interact with source control, git allows to
to record your changes in small commits that record exactly what you
did.

p. For example, suppose you editted three files (@a.rb@, @b.rb@, and
@c.rb@).  Now you want to commit all the changes, but you want the
changes in @a.rb@ and @b.rb@ to be a single commit, while the changes
to @c.rb@ are not logically related to the first two files and should
be a separate commit.

p. You could do the following:

pre(instructions). 
git add a.rb
git add b.rb
git commit -m 'Changes for a and b'

pre(instructions). 
git add c.rb
git commit -m 'Unrelated change to c'

p. By separating staging and committing, you have the ability to
easily fine tune what goes into each commit

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Commiting Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn how to commit changes to the repository

h2. Steps

h3. Commit the change

p. Ok, enough about staging.  Let's commit what we have staged to the
repository.

p. When you used @git commit@ previously to commit the initial version
of the @hello.rb@ file to the repository, you included the @-m@ flag
that gave a comment on the command line.  The commit command will
allow you to interactively edit a comment for the commit.  Let's try
that now.

p. If you omit the @-m@ flag from the command line, git will pop you
into the editor of your choice.  The editor is chosen from the
following list (in priority order):

* GIT_EDITOR environment variable
* core.editor configuration setting
* VISUAL environment variable
* EDITOR environment variable

p. I have the EDITOR variable set to @emacsclient@.

p. So commit now and check the status.

Execute:
-git commit
+git commit -m 'Using ARGV'

p. You should see the following in your editor:

Output:
|
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	modified:   hello.rb
#
EOF
 
p. On the first line, enter the comment: "Using ARGV".  Save the file
and exit the editor.  You should see ...

Output:
git commit
Waiting for Emacs...
[master 569aa96] Using ARGV
 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)
EOF

p. The "Waiting for Emacs..." line comes from the @emacsclient@
program which sends the file to a running emacs program and waits for
the file to be closed.  The rest of the output is the standard commit
messages.

h3. Check the status

p. Finally let's check the status again.

Execute:
!git status
=status

You should see ...

Output:
=status
EOF

p. The working directory is clean and ready for you to continue.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Changes, not Files

h2. Goals

* Learn the git works with changes, not files.

h2. Steps

p. Most source control systems work with files.  You add a file to
source control and the system will track changes to the file from that
point on.

p. Git focuses on the changes to a file rather than the file itself.
When you say @git add file@, you are not telling git to add the file
to the repository.  Rather you are saying that git should make note of
the current state of that file to be commited later.

p. We will attempt to explore that difference in this lab.

h3. First Change: Allow a default name

p. Change the "Hello, World" program to have a default value if a
command line argument is not supplied.

File: hello.rb
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

h3. Add this Change

p. Now add this change to the git's staging area.

Execute:
git add hello.rb

h3. Second change: Add a comment

p. Now add a comment to the "Hello, World" program.

File: hello.rb
# Default is "World"
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

h3. Check the current status

Execute:
!git status
=status

p. You should see ...

Output:
=status
EOF

p. Notice how @hello.rb@ is listed twice in the status.  The first
change (adding a default) is staged and is ready to be committed.  The
second change (adding a comment) is unstaged.  If you were to commit
right now, the comment would not be saved in the repository.

p. Let's try that

h3. Commiting

p. Commit the stage change (the default value), and then recheck the
status.

Execute:
git commit -m 'Added a default value'
=commit
git status
=status2

p. You should see ...

Output:
=commit
=status2
EOF

p. The status command is telling you that @hello.rb@ has unrecorded changes,
but is no longer in the staging area.  The 

h3. Add the Second Change

p. Now add the second change to staging area, then run git status.

Execute:
git add .
!git status
=status3

p(((((note). <b>Note:</b> We used the current directory ('.') as the
file to add.  This is a really convenient shortcut for adding in all
the changes to the files in the current directory and below.  Since it
adds everything, its a good idea to run the status before doing an
"add .".

p. You should see ...

Output:
=status3
EOF

p. Now the second change has been staged and is ready to commit.

h3. Commit the Second Change

Execute:
git commit -m 'Added a comment'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. History

h2. Goals

* Learn how to view the history of the project.

h2. Steps

p. Getting a listing of what changes have been made is the function of
the @git log@ command.

Execute:
git log
=log

p. You should see ...

Output:
=log
EOF

p. Here is a list of all four commits that we have made to the
repository so far.

h3. One Line Histories

p. You have a great deal o control of exactly what the @log@ command
displays.  I like the one line format:

Execute:
git log --pretty=oneline
=oneline

p. You should see ...

Output:
=oneline
EOF

h3. Controlling Which Entries are Displayed

p. There are a lot of options for selecting which entries are
displayed in the log.  Play around with the following options:

pre(instructions).
git log --pretty=oneline --max-count=2
git log --pretty=oneline --since='5 minutes ago' 
git log --pretty=oneline --until='5 minutes ago' 
git log --pretty=oneline --author=<your name>
git log --pretty=oneline --all

p. See man git-log for all the details.

h3. Getting Fancy

p. Here's what I use to review the changes made in the last week.
I'll add a --author=jim to it I only want to see changes I made.

pre(instructions).
git log --all --pretty=format:"%h %cd %s (%an)" --since='7 days ago'

h3. The Ultimate Log Format

p. Over time, I've decided that I like the following log format for
most of my work.

Execute:
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %ad %s%d [%an]" --graph --date=short
=ultimate

It looks like this:

Output:
=ultimate
EOF

p. Let's look at it in detail:

* @--pretty="..."@ defines the format of the output.
* @%h@ is the abbreviated hash of the commit
* @%d@ are any decorations on that commit (e.g. branch heads or tags)
* @%ad@ is the author date
* @%s@ is the comment
* @%an@ is the author name
* @--graph@ informs git to display the commit tree in an ASCII graph layout
* @--date=short@ keeps the date format nice and short

p. This is a lot to type everytime you want to see the log.
Fortunately we will learn about git aliases in the next lab.

h3. Other Tools

p. Both <code>gitx</code> (for Macs) and <code>gitk</code> (any
platform) are useful in exploring log history.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. Aliases

h2. Goals

* Learn how to setup aliases and shortcuts for git commands

h2. Steps

h3. Common Aliases

p. Git status, git add, git commit, and git checkout are such common
commands that it is useful to have abbreviations for them.

p. Add the following to the .gitconfig file in your $HOME directory.

file: .gitconfig
[alias]
  co = checkout
  ci = commit
  st = status
  br = branch
 hist = log --pretty=format:\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\" --graph --date=short
  type = cat-file -t
  dump = cat-file -p
EOF

p. We've covered checkout, commit and status already.  And we just
covered the @log@ command in the previous lab. Nowyou can type @git
co@ whereever you used to have to type @git checkout@.  Likewise with
@git st@ for @git status@ and @git ci@ for @git commit@.  And best of
all, @git hist@ will allow you to avoid the really long @log@ command.

p. Go ahead and give the new commands a try.

h3. Define the @hist@ alias in your @.gitconfig@ file

p. For the most part, I will continue to type out the full command in
these instructions.  The only exception is that I will use the @hist@
alias defined above anytime we need to see the git log output.  Make
sure you have a @hist@ alias setup in your @.gitconfig@ file before
continuing if you wish to follow along.

h3. @Type@ and @Dump@

p. We've added a few aliases for command we haven't covered yet. The
@git branch@ command will be coming up soon.  And the @git cat-file@
command is useful for exploring git, which we will see in the next
section.

h3. Shell Aliases

p. If your shell supports aliases or shortcuts, then you can add
aliases at that level too.  Here are the ones I use:

file: .profile
alias gs='git status '
alias ga='git add '
alias gb='git branch '
alias gc='git commit'
alias gd='git diff'
alias go='git checkout '
alias gk='gitk --all&'
alias gx='gitx --all'

alias got='git '
alias get='git '
EOF

p. The @go@ abbreviation for @git checkout@ is particularly nice.  It
allows me to type.

pre(instructions). go <branch>

p. to checkout a particular branch.

p. And yes, I do mistype @git@ as @get@ or @got@ often enough to
create aliases for them.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
h1. Getting Old Versions

h2. Goals

* Learn how to checkout any previous snapshot into the working directory.

h2. Steps

p. Going back in history is very easy.  The checkout command will copy
any snapshot from the repository to the working directory.

h3. Get the hashes for previous versions

Execute:
git hist
=log

p(((((note). *Note:* You did remember to define @hist@ in your
@.gitconfig@ file, right?  If not, review the lab on aliases.

Output:
=log
EOF

p. Examine the log output and find the hash for the first commit.  It
should be the last line of the @git hist@ output.  Use that hash code
(the first 8 characters is enough) in the command below.  Then check
the contents of the hello.rb file.

Set: hash=hash_for("First Commit")
Execute:
git checkout <hash>
=checkout
cat hello.rb
=cat

p(((((note). *Note:* The commands given here are Unix commands and 
work on both Mac and Linux boxes.  Unfortunately, Windows users will
have to translate to their native commands.  

p(((((note). *Note:* Many commands depend on the hash values in the
repository.  Since your hash values will vary from mine, whenever you
see something like &lt;hash&gt; or &lt;treehash&gt; in the command,
substitute in the proper hash value for your repository.

p. You should see ...

Output:
=checkout
=cat
EOF

p. You can ignore the comments about not being on a local branch.
That's ok for now.  Notice the contents of the hello.rb file are the
original contents.

h3. Return the latest version in the master branch

Execute:
git checkout master
=checkout2
cat hello.rb
=cat2

p. You should see ...

Output:
=checkout2
=cat2
EOF

p. 'master' is the name of the default branch.  By checking out a branch
by name, you go to the lastest version of that branch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Tagging versions

h2. Goals

* Learn how to tag commits with names for future reference

h2. Steps

p. Let's call the current version of the hello program version 1 (v1).

h3. Tagging version 1

Execute:
git tag v1
=tag

p. Now you can refer to the current version of the program as v1.  

h3. Tagging Previous Versions

p. Let's tag the version immediately prior to the current version
v1-beta.  First we need to checkout the previous version.  Rather than
lookup up the hash, we will use the ^ notation to indicate "the parent
of v1".

Execute:
git checkout v1^
=checkout 
cat hello.rb
=cat

Output:
=checkout
=cat
EOF

p. See, this is the version with the default value _before_ we added
the comment.  Let's make this v1-beta.

Execute:
git tag v1-beta

h3. Checking Out by Tag Name

p. Now try going back and forth between the two tagged versions.

Execute:
git checkout v1
=cov1 
git checkout v1-beta
=cov1beta

Output:
=cov1
=cov1beta
EOF

h3. Viewing Tags using the @tag@ command

p. You can see what tags are available using the @git tag@ command.

Execute:
git tag
=tag2

Output:
=tag2
EOF

h3. Viewing Tags in the Logs

p. You can also check for tags in the log.

Execute:
git hist master --all
=hist

Output:
=hist
EOF

p. You can see both tags (@v1@ and @v1-beta@) listed in the log
output, along with the branch name (@master@).  Also @HEAD@ shows you
the currently checked out commit (which is @v1-beta@ at the moment).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Reverting Local Changes (before staging)

h2. Goals

* Learn how to revert changes in the working directory

h2. Steps

h3. Checkout Master

p. Make sure you are on the lastest commit in master before proceeding.

Execute:
git checkout master

h3. Change hello.rb
 
p. Sometimes you have modified a file in your local working directory
and you wish to just revert to what has already been commited.  The
checkout command will handle that.

Change hello.rb to have a bad comment.

File: hello.rb
# This is a bad comment.  We want to revert it.
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

h3. Check the Status

p. First, check the status of the working directory.

Execute:
!git status
=status

Output:
=status
EOF

p. We see that the @hello.rb@ file has been modified, but hasn't been
staged yet.

h3. Revert the changes in the working directory

p. Use the @checkout@ command to checkout the repository's version of
the @hello.rb@ file.

Execute:
git checkout hello.rb
=checkout
!git status
=status2
cat hello.rb    
=cat

Output:
=checkout
=status2
=cat
EOF

p. The status command shows us that there are no outstanding changes
in the working directory.  And the "bad comment" is no longer part of
the file contents.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Reverting Staged Changes (before committing)

h2. Goals

* Learn how to revert changes that have been staged

h2. Steps

h3. Change the file and stage the change

p. Modify the @hello.rb@ file to have a bad comment

File: hello.rb
# This is an unwanted but staged comment
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

p. And then go ahead and stage it.

Execute:
git add hello.rb

h3. Check the Status

p. Check the status of your unwanted change.

Execute:
git status
=status

Output:
=status
EOF

p. The status output shows that the change has been staged and is
ready to be committed.

h3. Reset the Staging Area

p. Fortunately the status output tells us exactly what we need to do
to unstage the change.

Execute:
git reset HEAD hello.rb
=reset

Output:
=reset
EOF

p. The @reset@ command resets the staging area to be whatever is in
HEAD.  This clears the staging area of the change we just staged.

p. The @reset@ command (by default) doesn't change the working
directory.  So the working directory still has the unwanted comment in
it.  We can use  the @checkout@ command of the previous lab to remove
the unwanted change from the working directory.

h3. Checkout the Commited Version

Execute:
git checkout hello.rb
git status
=status2

Output:
=status2
EOF

p. And our working directory is clean once again.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Reverting Committed Changes 

h2. Goals

* Learn how to revert changes that have been committed to a local repository.

h2. Steps

h3. Undoing Commits

p. Sometimes you realized that a change that you have already
committed was not correct and you wish to undo that commit.  There are
several ways of handling that issue, and the way we are going to use
in this lab is always safe to use.

p. Essentially we will undo the commit by creating a new commit that
reverses the unwanted changes.

h3. Change the file and commit it.

p. Change the @hello.rb@ file to the following.

File: hello.rb
# This is an unwanted but committed change
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

Execute:
git add hello.rb
git commit -m "Oops, we didn't want this commit"

h3. Create a Reverting Commit

p. To undo a committed change, we need to generate a commit that
removes the changes introduced by our unwanted commit.

Execute:
-git revert head
+git revert head --no-edit
=revert

p. This will pop you into the editor.  Edit the commit message and
close the file.  You should see ...

Output:
=revert
EOF

p. Since we were undoing the very last commit we made We were able to
use @head@ as the argument to revert.  We can revert any arbitrary
commit earlier in history by simply specifying its hash value.

h3. Check the log

p. Checking the log shows both the unwanted and the reverting commits
in our repository.

Execute:
git hist
=hist

Output:
=hist
EOF

p. This technique will work with any commit (although you may have to
resolve conflicts).  It is safe to use even on branches that are
publicly shared on remote repositories.

h3. Up Next

p. Next, let's look at a technique that can be used to remove the most
recent commits from the repository history.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Removing Commits from a Branch

h2. Goals

* Learn how to remove the most recent commits from a branch

h2. Steps

p. The @revert@ command of the previous section is a powerful command
that lets us undo the effects of any commit in the repository.
However, both the original commit and the "undoing" commit are visible
in the branch history (using the @git log@ command).

p. Often we make a commit and immediately realize that it was a
mistake.  It would be nice to have a "take back" command that would
allow us to pretend that the incorrect commit never happened.  The
"take back" command would even prevent the bad commit from showing up
the @git log@ history.  It would be as if the bad commit never
happened.

h3. The @reset@ command

p. We've already seen the @reset@ command and have used it to set the
staging area to be consistent with a given commit (we used the HEAD
commit in our previous lab).

p. When given a commit reference (i.e. a hash, branch or tag name),
the @reset@ command will ...

# Rewrite the current branch to point to the specified commit
# Optionally reset the staging area to match the specified commit
# Optionally reset the working directory to match the specified commit

h3. Check Our History

p. Let's do a quick check of our commit history.

Execute:
git hist
=hist

Output:
=hist
EOF

p. We see that we have an "Oops" commit and a "Revert Oops" commit as
the last two commits made in this branch.  Let's remove them using
reset.

h3. First, Mark this Branch

p. But before we remove the commits, let's mark the latest commit with
a tag so we can find it again.

Execute:
git tag oops

h3. Reset to Before Oops

p. Looking at the log history (above), we see that the commit tagged
'v1' is the commit right before the bad commit.  Let's reset the
branch to that point.  Since that branch is tagged, we can use the tag
name in the reset command (if it wasn't tagged, we could just use the
hash value).

Execute:
git reset --hard v1
=reset
git hist
=hist2

Output:
=reset 
=hist2
EOF

p. Our master branch now points to the v1 commit and the Oops commit
and the Revert Oops commit are no longer in the branch.  The @--hard@
parameter indicates that the working directory should be updated to be
consistent with the new branch head.

h3. Nothing is Ever Lost

p. But what happened to the bad commits?  It turns out that the
commits are still in the repository.  In fact, we can still reference
them.  Remember that at the beginning of this lab we tagged the
reverting commit with the tag "oops".  Lets look at _all_ the commits.

Execute:
git hist --all
=hist3

Output:
=hist3
EOF

p. Here we see that the bad commits haven't disappeared.  They are
still in the repository.  It's just that they are no longer listed in
the master branch.  If we hadn't tagged them, they would still be in
the repository, but there would be no way to reference them other than
using their hash names.  Commits that are unreferenced remain in the
repository until the system runs the garbage collection software.

h3. Dangers of Reset

p. Resets on local branches are generally safe.  Any "accidents" can
usually be recovered from by just resetting again with the desired
commit.

p. However, if the branch is shared on remote repositories, resetting
can confuse other users sharing the branch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Remove the oops tag

h2. Goals

* Remove the oops tag (housekeeping)

h2. Steps

h3. Removing tag oops

p. The oops tag has served its purpose.  Let's remove it an allow the
commits it referenced to be garbage collected.

Execute:
git tag -d oops
=tag
git hist --all
=hist

Output:
=tag
=hist
EOF

p. The oops tag is no longer listed in the repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Amending Commits

h2. Goals

* Learn how to amend an existing commit

h2. Steps

h3. Change the program then commit

p. Add an author commit to the program.

File: hello.rb
# This is an unwanted but committed change
# Author: Jim Weirich
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Add an author comment'

h3. Oops, Should have an Email

p. After you make the commit, you realize that any good author comment
should have an email included.  Update the hello program to include an
email.

File: hello.rb
# This is an unwanted but committed change
# Author: Jim Weirich (jim@somewhere.com)
name = ARGV.first || "World"

puts "Hello, #{name}!"
EOF

h3. Ammend the Previous Commit

p. We really don't want a separate commit for just the email.  Let's
amend the previous commit to include the email change.

Execute:
git add .
=add
git commit --amend -m 'Add an author/email comment'
=commit

Output:
=add
=commit
EOF


h3. Review the History

Execute:
git hist
=hist

Output:
=hist
EOF

p. We can see the original "author" commit is now gone, and it is
replaced by the "author/email" commit.  You can achieve the same
effect by resetting the branch back one commit and then recommitting
the new changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Moving Files
 
h2. Goals

* Learn how to move a file within a repository.

h2. Steps

h3. Move the hello.rb file into a lib directory.

p. We are now going to build up the structure our little repository.
Let's move the program into a lib directory.

Execute:
mkdir lib
=mkdir
git mv hello.rb lib
=move
!git status
=status

Output:
=mkdir
=move
=status
EOF

p. By using git to do the move, we inform git of 2 things 

# That the file @hello.rb@ has been deleted.
# The file @lib/hello.rb@ has been created.

p. Both of these bits of information are immediately staged and ready
to be commited.  The git status command reports that the file has been
moved.

h3. Another way of moving files

p. One of the nice things about git is that you can forget about
source control until the point you are ready to start committing code.
What would happen if we used the operating system command to move the
file instead of the git command?

p. It turns out the following set of commands is identical to what we
just did.  Its a bit more work, but the result is the same.

p(command). We could have done:

pre(instructions). mkdir lib
mv hello.rb lib
git add lib/hello.rb
git rm hello.rb

h3. Commit the new directory

p. Let's commit this move.

Execute:
git commit -m 'Moved hello.rb to lib'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. More Structure

h2. Goals

* Add another file to our repository

h2. Steps

h3. Now add a Rakefile

p. Let's add a rakefile to our repository.  The following one will do
nicely.

File: Rakefile
#!/usr/bin/ruby -wKU

task :default => :run

task :run do
  require 'lib/hello'
end
EOF

p. Add and commit the change.

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Added a Rakefile.'

p. You should be able to use Rake to run your hello program now.

Execute:
rake
=rake

Output:
=rake
EOF

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Git Internals: The .git directory 

h2. Goals

* Learn about the structure of the @.git@ directory

h3. The @.git@ Directory

p. Time to do some exploring.  First, from the root of your project
directory...

Execute:
cls -C .git
=lsgit

Output:
=lsgit
EOF

p. This is the magic directory where all the git "stuff" is stored.
Let's peek in the objects directory.

h3. The Object Store
 
Execute:
ls -C .git/objects
=lsobjs

Output:
=lsobjs
EOF

p. You should see a bunch of directories with 2 letter names.  The
directory names are the first two letters of the sha1 hash of the
object stored in git.

h3. Deeper into the Object Store

Set: dir=`ls .git/objects | head -1`.strip
Execute:
ls -C .git/objects/<dir>
=lsobjs2

Output:
=lsobjs2
EOF

p. Look in one of the two-letter directories.  You should see some
files with 38 character names.  These are the files that contain the
objects stored in git.  These files are compressed and encoded, so
looking at their contents directly won't be very helpful, but we will
take a closer look in a bit.

h3. Config File

Execute:
cat .git/config
=cat

Output:
=cat
EOF

p. This is project specific configuration file.  Config entries in
here will override the config entries in the @.gitconfig@ file in your
home directory, at least for this project.

h3. Branches and Tags

Execute:
ls .git/refs
=refs
ls .git/refs/heads
=refhead 
ls .git/refs/tags
=reftags
cat .git/refs/tags/v1
=refv1

Output:
=refs
=refhead 
=reftags
=refv1
EOF

p. You should recogize the files in the tags subdirectory.  Each file
corresponds to a tag you created with the @git tag@ command earlier.
It's content is just the hash of the commit tied to the tag.

p. The heads directory is similar, but is used for branches rather
than tags.  We only have one branch at the moment, so all you will see
is master in this directory.

h3. The HEAD File

Execute:
cat .git/HEAD
=head

Output:
=head
EOF

p. The HEAD file contains a reference to the current branch.  Should
be a reference to master at this point.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Git Internals: Working directly with Git Objects

h2. Goals

* Explore the structure of the object store
* Learn how to use the SHA1 hashes to find content in the repository

h2. Steps

p. Now let's use some tools to probe git objects directly.

h3. Finding the Latest Commit

Execute:
git hist --max-count=1
=log

p. This should show the latest commit made in the repository.  The
SHA1 hash on your system is probably different that what is on mine,
but you should see something like this.

Output:
=log
EOF

h3. Dumping the Latest Commit

Using the SHA1 hash from the commit listed above ...

Set: hash=hash_for("Added a Rakefile")
Execute:
git cat-file -t <hash>
=type
git cat-file -p <hash>
=dump

Here's my output ...

Output:
=type
=dump
EOF

p(((((note). *NOTE:* If you defined the 'type' and 'dump' aliases from 
the aliases lab, then you can type @git type@ and @git dump@ rather
than the longer cat-file commands (which I never remember).

p. This is the dump of the commit object that is at the head of the
master branch.  It looks a lot like the commit object from the
presentation earlier.

h3. Finding the Tree
 
p. We can dump the directory tree referenced in the commit.  This
should be a description of the (top level) files in our project (for
that commit).  Use the SHA1 hash from the "tree" line listed above.

Set: treehash=hash_in(var['hash'], 'tree')
Execute:
git cat-file -p <treehash>
=treedump

p. Here's what my tree looks like...

Output:
=treedump
EOF

p. Yep, I see the Rakefile and the lib directory.  

h3. Dumping the lib directory
 
Set: libhash=hash_in(var['treehash'], 'lib') 
Execute:
git cat-file -p <libhash>
=libdump

Output:
=libdump
EOF

p. There's the @hello.rb@ file. 
 
h3. Dumping the @hello.rb@ file

Set: rbhash=hash_in(var['libhash'], 'hello')
Execute:
git cat-file -p <rbhash>
=rbdump

Output:
=rbdump
EOF

p. There you have it.  We've dumped commit objects, tree objects and
blob objects directly from the git repository.  That's all that is
there, blobs, trees and commits.

h3. Explore On You Own

p. Explore the git repo manually on your own.  See if you can find the
original hello.rb file from the very first commit by manually
following the SHA1 hash references starting in the latest commit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Creating a Branch

h2. Goals

* Learn how to create a local branch in a repository

h2. Steps

p. It's time to do a major rewrite of the hello world functionality.
Since this might take awhile, you want to put these changes into a
separate branch to isolate them from changes in master.

h3. Create a Branch

p. Let's call our new branch 'greet'.

Execute:
git checkout -b greet
!git status

p. Notice that the git status command reports that you are on the
'greet' branch.

h3. Changes for Greet: Add a Greeter class.

File: lib/greeter.rb
class Greeter
  def initialize(who)
    @who = who
  end
  def greet
    "Hello, #{@who}"
  end
end
EOF

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Added greeter class'

h3. Changes for Greet: Modify the main program

p. Update the hello.rb file to use greeter

File: lib/hello.rb
require 'greeter'

# Default is World
name = ARGV.first || "World"

greeter = Greeter.new(name)
puts greeter.greet
EOF

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Hello uses Greeter'

h3. Changes for Greet: Update the Rakefile

p. Update the Rakefile to use an external ruby process

File: Rakefile
#!/usr/bin/ruby -wKU

task :default => :run

task :run do
  ruby '-Ilib', 'lib/hello.rb'
end
EOF

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Updated Rakefile'

h3. Up Next

p. We now have a new branch called *greet* with 3 new commits on it.
Next we will learn who to navigate and switch between branches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Navigating Branches

h2. Goals

* Learn how to navigate between the branches of a repository

h2. Steps

p. You now have two branches in your project:

Execute:
git hist --all
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

h3. Switch to the Master Branch

p. Just use the @git checkout@ command to switch between branches. 

Execute:
git checkout master
=checkout
cat lib/hello.rb
=cat

Output:
=checkout
=cat
EOF

p. You are now on the master branch.  You can tell because the
hello.rb file doesn't use the @Greeter@ class.

h3. Switch Back to the Greet Branch.

Execute:
git checkout greet
=checkout2
cat lib/hello.rb
=cat2

Output:
=checkout2
=cat2
EOF

p. The contents of the @lib/hello.rb@ confirms we are back on the
*greet* branch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Changes in Master

h2. Goals

* Learing how to deal with multiple branches with different (and possibly conflicting) changes.

h2. Steps

p. While you were changing the greet branch, someone else decided to
update the master branch.  They added a README.

h3. Update the README file with changes.

File: README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
EOF

h3. Commit the README changes to master.

Execute:
git checkout master
git add README
git commit -m 'Added README'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Viewing Diverging Branches

h2. Goals

* Learn how to view diverging branches in a repository.

h2. Steps

h3. View the Current Branches

p. We now have two diverging branches in the repository.  Use the
following log command to view the branches and how they diverge.

Execute:
git hist --all
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. Here is our first chance to see the --graph option on @git hist@ in
action. Adding the --graph option to git log causes it to draw the
commit tree using simple ASCII characters.  We can see both branches
(greet and master), and that the master branch is the current HEAD.
The common ancestor to both branches is the "Added a Rakefile" branch.

p. The @--all@ flag makes sure that we see all the branches.  The
default is to show only the current branch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Merging

h2. Goals

* Learning who to merge two diverging branches to bring the changes back into a single branch.

h2. Steps

h3. Merge the branches

p. Merging brings the changes in two branches together.  Let's go back
to the greet branch and merge master onto greet.

Execute:
git checkout greet
=checkout
git merge master
=merge
git hist --all
=hist

Output:
=checkout
=merge
=hist
EOF

p. By merging master into your greet branch periodically, you can pick
up any changes to master and keep your changes in greet compatible
with changes in the mainline.

p. However, it does produce ugly commit graphs. Latter we will look at
the option of rebasing rather than merging.

h3. Up Next

p. But first, what if the changes in master conflict with the changes
in greet?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Creating a Conflict

h2. Goals

* Create a conflicting change in the master branch.

h2. Steps

h3. Switch back to master and create a conflict

p. Switch back to the master branch and make this change:

Execute:
git checkout master

File: lib/hello.rb
# Default is World

puts "What's your name"
my_name = gets.strip

puts "Hello, #{my_name}!"
EOF

Execute:
git add .
git commit -m 'Made interactive'

h3. View the Branches

Execute:
git hist --all
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. Master at commit "Added README" has been merged to the greet
branch, but there is now an additional commit on master that has not
been merged back to greet.

h3. Up Next

p. The latest change in master conflicts with some existing changes in
greet.  Next we will resolve those changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Resolving Conflicts

h2. Goals

* Learn how to handle conflicts during a merge

h2. Steps

h3. Merge master to greet

p. Now go back to the greet branch and try to merge the new master.

Execute:
git checkout greet
!git merge master

Output:
$ git checkout greet
Switched to branch 'greet'
$ git merge master
Auto-merging lib/hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in lib/hello.rb
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
EOF

If you open lib/hello.rb, you will see:

file: lib/hello.rb
<<<<<<< HEAD
require 'greeter'

# Default is World
name = ARGV.first || "World"

greeter = Greeter.new(name)
puts greeter.greet
=======
# Default is World

puts "What's your name"
my_name = gets.strip

puts "Hello, #{my_name}!"
>>>>>>> master
EOF

p. The first section is the version on the head of the current branch
(greet).  The second section is the version on the master branch.

h3. Fix the Conflict

p. You need to manually resolve the conflict.  Modify @lib/hello.rb@
to be the following.

File: lib/hello.rb
require 'greeter'

# Default is World

puts "What's your name"
my_name = gets.strip

greeter = Greeter.new(my_name)
puts greeter.greet
EOF

h3. Commit the Conflict Resolution

Execute:
git add lib/hello.rb
=add
git commit -m 'Merged master fixed conflict.'
=commit

Output:
=add
=commit
EOF

h3. Advanced Merging

p. git doesn't provide any graphical merge tools, but it will gladly
work with any third party merge tool you wish to use.  See
"http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Git/UsingP4MergeWithGit.red":http://onestepback.org/index.cgi/Tech/Git/UsingP4MergeWithGit.red
for a description of using the Perforce merge tool with git.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Rebasing VS Merging

h2. Goals

* Learn the differences between rebasing and merging.

h2. Discussion

p. Let's explore the differences between merging and rebasing.  In
order to do so, we need to rewind the repository back in time before
the first merge, and then redo the same steps, but using rebasing
rather than merging.

p. We will make use the of the @reset@ command to wind the branches
back in time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Resetting the Greet Branch

h2. Goals

* Reset the greet branch to the point before the first merge.

h2. Steps

h3. Reset the greet branch

p. Let's go back in time on the greet branch to the point _before_ we
merged master onto it.  We can *reset* a branch to any commit we want.
Essentially this is modifying the branch pointer to point to anywhere
in the commit tree.

p. In this case we want to back greet up to the point prior to the
merge with master.  We need to find the last commit before the merge.

Execute:
git hist
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. That's a bit hard to read, but looking at the data we see that the
"Updated Rakefile" commit was the last commit on the greet branch
before merging.  Let's reset the greet branch to that commit.

Set: hash=hash_for("Updated Rakefile")
Execute:
git reset --hard <hash>
=reset

Output:
=reset
EOF

h3. Check the branch.

p. Look at the log for the greet branch.  We no longer have the merge
commits in its history.

Execute:
git hist --all
=log2

Output:
=log2
EOF

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Resetting the Master Branch

h2. Goals

* Reset the master branch to the point before the conflicting commit.

h2. Steps

h3. Reset the master branch

p. When we added the interactive mode to the master branch, we made a
change that conflicted with changes in the greed branch. Let's rewind
the master branch to a point before the conflicting change.  This
allows us to demonstrate the rebase command without worrying about
conflicts.

Execute:
git checkout master
git hist
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. The 'Added README' commit is the one directly before the
conflicting interactive mode.  We will reset the master branch to
'Added README' branch.

Set: hash=hash_for("Added README")
Execute:
git reset --hard <hash>
git hist --all
=log2

p. Review the log.  It should look like the repository has been wound
back in time to the point before we merged anything.

Output:
=log2
EOF

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Rebasing

h2. Goals

* Use the rebase command rather than the merge command.

h2. Steps

p. Ok, we are back in time before the merge and we want to get the
changes in master into our greet branch.

Execute:
git checkout greet
git rebase master
git hist
=log

Output:
$ go greet
Switched to branch 'greet'
$
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added Greeter class
Applying: hello uses Greeter
Applying: updated Rakefile
$
=log
EOF

h3. Merge VS Rebase

p. The final result of the rebase is very similar to the merge.  The
greet branch now contains all of its changes, as well as all the
changes from the master branch.  However, the commit tree is quite
different.  The commit tree for the greet branch has been rewritten so
that the master branch is a part of the commit history.  This leaves
the chain of commits linear and much easier to read.

h3. When to Rebase, When to Merge?

p. Don't use rebase ...

# If the branch is public and shared with others.  Writing publicly shared branches will tend to screw up other members of the team.
# When the _exact_ history of the commit branch is important (since rebase rewrites the commit history).

p. Given the above guidelines, I tend to use rebase for short-lived,
local branches and merge for branches in the public repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Merging Back to Master

h2. Goals

* We've kept our greet branch up to date with master (via rebase), now lets merge the greet changes back into the master branch.

h2. Steps

h3 Merge greet into master

Execute:
git checkout master
git merge greet
=merge

Output:
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$
=merge
EOF
 
p. Because the head of master is a direct ancestor of the head of the
greet branch, git is able to do a fast forward merge.  When
fast-forwarding, the branch pointer is simply moved forward to point
to same commit as the greeter branch.

p. There will never be conflicts in a fast forward merge.

h3. Review the logs

Execute:
git hist
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. The greet and master branches are now identical.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Cloning Repositories

h2. Goals

* Learn how to make copies of repositories.

h2. Steps

h3. Go to the work directory

p. Go to the working directory and make a clone of your hello
repository.

Execute:
cd ..
=cd
pwd
=pwd
ls
=ls

Output:
=cd
=pwd
=ls
EOF

p. At this point you should be in your "work" directory.  There should
be a single repository here named "hello".

h3. Create a clone of the hello repository

p. Let's make a clone of the repository.

Execute:
git clone hello cloned_hello
=clone
ls
=ls2

Output:
=clone
=ls2
EOF

p. There should now be two repositories in your work directory: the
original "hello" repository and the newly cloned "cloned_hello"
repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Review the Cloned Repository

h2. Goals

* Learn about branches on remote repositories.

h3. Look at the cloned repository

p. Let's take a look at the cloned repository.

Execute:
cd cloned_hello
=cd
ls
=ls

Output:
=cd
EOF

p. You should see a list of all the files in the top level of the
original repository (@README@, @Rakefile@ and @lib).


h3. Review the Repository History

Execute:
git hist --all
=log

Output:
=log
EOF

p. You should now see a list of the all the commits in the new
repository, and it should (more or less) match the history of commits
in the original repository.  The only difference should be in the
names of the branches.

h3. Remote branches

p. You should see a *master* branch (along with *HEAD*) in the history
list.  But you will also have number of strangely named branches
(*origin/master*, *origin/greet* and *origin/HEAD*).  We'll talk about
them in a bit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. What is Origin?

h2. Goals

* Learn about naming remote repositories.

h2. Steps

Execute:
git remote
=remote

Output:
=remote
EOF

p. We see that the cloned repository knows about a remote repository
named origin.  Let's see if we can get more information about origin:

Execute:
git remote show origin 
=show

Output:
=show
EOF

p. Now we see that the remote repository origin is simply the original
*hello* repository.  There is nothing particularly special about the
name "origin", however the convention is to use the name 'origin' for
the primary centralized repository (if there is one).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Remote Branches

h2. Goals

* Learn about local VS remote branches

h2. Steps

p. Let's look at the branches available in our cloned repository.

Execute:
git branch
=branch

Output:
=branch
EOF

p. That's it, only the master branch is listed.  Where is the greet
branch?  The *git* *branch* command only lists the local branches by
default.

h3. List Remote Branches

p. Try this to see all the branches:

Execute:
git branch -a
=branch_a

Output:
=branch_a
EOF

p. Git has all the commits from the original reposistory, but branches
in the remote repository are not treated as local branches here.  If
we want our own *greet* branch, we need to create it ourselves. We
will see how to do that in a minute.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Change the Original Repository

h2. Goals

* Make some changes to the original repository so we can try to pull the changes

h2. Steps

h3. Make a change in the original *hello* repository

Execute:
cd ../hello
+pwd
# (You should be in the original hello repository now)

p. Make the following changes to README:

File: README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
(changed in original)
EOF

p. Now add and commit this change

Execute:
git add README
git commit -m 'Changed REAME in original repo'

h3. Up Next

p. The original repository now has later changes that are not in the
cloned version.  Next we will pull those changes across to the cloned
repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Fetching Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn how to pull changes from a remote repository.

h2. Steps

Execute:
cd ../cloned_hello
+pwd
git fetch
=fetch

Output:
=fetch
EOF

p. At this point the repository has all the commits from the original
repository.  However, they have not been merged into the local master
branch.

h3. Check the README

Execute:
cat README

Output:
$ cat README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
EOF

p. See, no changes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Merging Pulled Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn to get the pulled changes into the current branch and working directory.

h2. Steps

h3. Merge the fetched changes into local master

Execute:
git merge origin/master
=merge

Output:
=merge
EOF

h3. Check the README again

p. We should see the changes now.

Execute:
cat README

Output:
$ cat README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
(changed in original)
EOF

p. There's the changes.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Pulling Changes

h2. Goals

* Learn that @git pull@ is equivalent to a @git fetch@ followed by a @git merge@.

h2. Discussion

p. We're not going to go through the process of creating another
change and pulling it again, but we do want you to know that doing:

pre(instructions). git pull

is indeed equivalent to the two step

pre(instructions). git fetch
git merge origin/master


































----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Local Branches

TBD

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Added a Tracking Branch

 (NOTE: Consider moving this section after the bare repository)

h2. Goals

* Learn how to add a local branch that tracks a remote branch.

h2. Steps

p. The branches starting with remotes/origin are branches from the
original repo.  Notice that you don't have a branch called greet
anymore, but it knows that the original repo had a greet branch.

h3. Add a local branch that tracks a remote branch.

Execute:
git branch --track greet origin/greet
=branch_track
git branch -a
=branch_a
git hist --max-count=1
=log

Output:
=branch_track
=branch_a
=log
EOF

p. We can now see the greet branch in the branch list and in the log.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Pulling changes

Switch back to the original repository and add a line to the readme.

Execute:
cd ../hello
+pwd
# (You should be in the original hello repository)

p. Change the README file

File: README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
(Changed in the original)
EOF

p. Commit the change

Execute:
git add README
git commit -m 'Updated README'

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Pull the Changes (TBD)

h2. Goal

* TBD

h2. Steps

h3. Now switch back to the cloned directory

Execute:
cd ../cloned_hello
+pwd
# (You should be in the cloned hello repository)
ls

p. We see the changes to README are not here yet.

h3. Fetch the Changes

Execute:
git fetch origin
=fetch
cat README
=cat

Output:
=fetch
=cat
EOF

p. The changes have been copied into the repository, but have not yet
been moved into the working directory.  We get the changes by merging
the changes in the remote branch into master.

Execute:
git merge origin/master

h3. Pulling

The fetch/merge commands can be done in one operation with pull.

Execute:
git pull origin

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Bare Repositories

Bare repositories (without working directories) are usually used for
sharing).

h3. Create a bare repository.

Execute:
cd ..
+pwd
# (You should be in the work directory)
git clone --bare hello hello.git
=clone
ls hello.git
=ls

Output:
=clone
=ls
EOF

p. The convention is that repositories ending in '.git' are bare
repositories.  We can see that there is no working directory in the
hello.git repo.  Essentially it is nothing but the .git directory of a
non-bare repo.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Adding a Remote Repository

p. Let's add the hello.git repo to our original repo.

Execute:
cd hello
+pwd
# (You should be in the original repository)
git remote add shared ../hello.git

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Pushing a Change

p. Edit the README and commit it

File: README
This is the Hello World example from the git tutorial.
(Changed in the original and pushed to shared)
EOF

Execute:
git checkout master
git add README
git commit -m 'Added shared comment to readme'

p. Now push the change to the shared repo.

Execute:
git push shared master
=push

Output:
=push
EOF

p(((((note). *NOTE:* We had to explicitly name the branch master that
we were pushing.  It is possible to set it up automatically, but I
_never_ remember the commands to do that.  Check out the "Git Remote
Branch" gem for easy management of remote branches.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Pulling Shared Changes

p. Quick hop over to the clone repository and lets pull down the
changes just pushed to the shared repo.

Execute:
cd ../cloned_hello
+pwd
# (You should be in the cloned repository)
git remote add shared ../hello.git
git branch --track shared master
git pull shared master
cat README

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Hosting your Git Repositories

p. There are many ways to share git repositories over the network.
Here is a quick and dirty way.

h3. Start up the git server

execute:
# (From the work directory)
git daemon --verbose --export-all --base-path=.

p. Now, in a separate terminal window, go to your work directory

execute:
# (From the work directory) 
git clone git:localhost/hello.git network_hello
cd network_hello
ls

p. You should see a copy of hello project.

h3. Pushing to the Git Daemon

p. If you want to push to the git daemon repository, add
@--enable=receive-pack@ to the git daemon command.  Be careful because
there is not authentication on this server, anyone could push to your
repository.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Sharing Repos

p. See if your neighbor is running the git daemon.  Exchange IP
addresses and see if you can pull from each other's repositories.

p(((((note). *NOTE:* The gitjour gem is really useful in sharing
ad-hoc repositories.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
h1. Advanced / Future Topics

p. Here are some topics you might want to research on your own:

* Reverting Committed Changes
* Cross OS Line Endings
* Remote Servers
* Protocols
* SSH Setup
* Remote Branch Management (git bisect)
* Finding Buggy Commits
* Workflows
* Non-command line tools (gitx, gitk, magit)
* Working with GitHub
